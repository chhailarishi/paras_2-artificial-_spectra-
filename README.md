# paras_2-artificial-_spectra

This package is for generating or simulating CCD output spectra for upcoming PARAS-2 spectrograph at PRL's Gurushikhar Observatory, Mount Abu, India. 
We use the wavelength position at various orders using the zemex software. Along with that, the code use the Sun's observed normalised spectra as an input. 

Then that raw spectra is convolved with efficiency of various optical elements od the spectrograph and the blaze efficiency.

Run 'get_spec.py'.
